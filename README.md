The E3AN project is a pioneering initiative aimed at repurposing non-functioning computers into a fully
operational and aesthetically appealing robot. With a focus on sustainability and innovation, the project
integrates various disciplines, including 3D design, mechanical work, Internet of Things (IoT)
technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI).
The project commenced with meticulous 3D design using AutoCAD for components such as the hand,
thigh, shin, foot, shoulder, and backbone. Pepakura paper crafting techniques were then employed to give
life to the outer covering, ensuring precision and attention to detail. Mechanical work, involving welding,
metal cutting, and shaping, transformed discarded electronic components into a cohesive and functional
robotic entity.
The integration of IoT technologies, centered around Arduino as the central control unit, showcased the
team's proficiency in harnessing electronic devices such as a motor driver, ultrasonic sensor, LED lights,
and servo motor. Python, chosen for its versatility, was employed for AI applications, including voice
recognition, dynamic video display, and real-time voice conversation.
The aesthetic appeal of the project was not overlooked, with the robot adorned in a striking black and
golden spray-painted finish. Motion sensor-driven face movement added an interactive and engaging
element, emphasizing the project's user-centric design.
This abstract encapsulates the multidisciplinary nature of the E3AN project, offering a glimpse into its
technical intricacies, innovative solutions, and the team's commitment to sustainable technology. The
project stands as a beacon of creativity, addressing the global challenge of e-waste through
transformative repurposing.

Project E3AN: Revitalizing Old Computers into a Smart E-Waste Robot
In an era of technological advancement, the imperative to address electronic waste (e-waste)
has never been more crucial. Embracing this challenge, our team embarked on a
groundbreaking project, breathing new life into non-functioning computers and
transforming them into a state-of-the-art robotic marvel â€“ Project E3AN.
The journey began with salvaging old computers that had reached the end of their
functional life. Undeterred by their initial state, we meticulously refurbished and
repurposed these machines, fashioning a resilient core for our robot.
The structural blueprint of E3AN took shape through intricate 3D designs crafted using
AutoCAD, ensuring precision and efficiency. To embellish its exterior, we employed
Pepakura, creating an aesthetically pleasing outer covering that complemented the
robot's sleek functionality.
For the internal framework, we opted for durability and lightness, employing an
aluminum frame. The body of the robot was sheathed in aluminum sheets, providing
both resilience and a modern, metallic finish.
Integrating the power of the Internet of Things (IoT), we utilized Arduino and other
electronic components to enable smart functionalities, pushing the boundaries of
innovation. Java and Python programming languages played a pivotal role in imbuing
E3AN with artificial intelligence and voice recognition capabilities, enhancing its
adaptability and responsiveness.
The video display, a crucial aspect of user interaction, was ingeniously realized by
repurposing a computer monitor. This not only contributed to sustainability but also
offered a familiar interface for users.
To add the finishing touches, the robot was meticulously painted with a combination of
black and golden spray paint, elevating its aesthetic appeal and ensuring it stood out as
a testament to creativity and innovation.
E3AN, the culmination of our endeavors, not only represents technological ingenuity
but also boasts a dynamic face equipped with a motion sensor. This feature enables the
robot's face to intuitively respond to the user's presence, creating a more immersive and
engaging interaction.
